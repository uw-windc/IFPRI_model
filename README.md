# IFPRI Model

To use this package clone the repository to your local machine. Activate and instantiate the environment. Exmaple code is in `main.jl`.

## Activating and Instantiating an Environment

In VSCode, open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "Julia: Change Current Environment" and select the directory where you cloned the repository.

After activating the environment, you need to instantiate the package to install all dependencies. You can do this by typing:

```julia
(ifpri_model)> instantiate
```

in the package manager. Get to the package manager by opening a REPL in the cloned directory and pressing `]`. If you see `(1.11) >` type `activate .`.
